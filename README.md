# Electrongram

Electrongram is a desktop client for Instagram.

It works by loading the Instagram mobile website and simulating a touch screen.

Unlke other desktop Instagram apps, we support practically everything including:

* Uploading/editing stories, and uploading new posts
* DMs
* Multi-account support (you can even have two accounts open at once)


## No longer actively developer

Given that Instagram support all of the above features from desktop web, this project is no longer being maintained.
